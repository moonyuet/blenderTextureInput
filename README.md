# blenderTextureInput
This is an add-on which simply generates a PBR shader with texture input parameters

For more information of how to install py as an add-on in Blender, please visit: https://github.com/moonyuet/ShaderLibraryBlendAdd-on

This is how the add-on looks like.

***Make sure you have all five maps otherwises the add-on cannot be loaded as restricted by python stringproperty in Blender

Update: I clean up the inputs a bit and the user can choose to include metallic or disaplacement by leaving the paths to blank.
