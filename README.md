# blenderTextureInput
This is an add-on which simply generates a PBR shader with texture input parameters

This is how the add-on looks like.

***Make sure you have all five maps otherwises the add-on cannot be loaded as restricted by python stringproperty in Blender

Update: I clean up the inputs a bit and the user can choose to include disaplacement or not.
